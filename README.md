## CuriShot: A Minimalist File Sharing and Organization Tool for Students
*This is a submission for the [The Pinata Challenge ](https://dev.to/challenges/pinata)*

## What I Built
CuriShot is a simple, minimalistic yet functional web app that allows college students to save code files and screenshots from software like MATLAB, LTspice, etc., during their lab classes. These files can be stored in the cloud and organized with tags, making it easier for students to access them later from their home systems. As a college fresher, I wanted to create something minimalistic yet intuitive, which led to the development of CuriShot.

## More Details
Pinata was used to store and retrieve all the files uploaded by users onto CuriShot. The IPFS hash of each uploaded file was saved in the user's profile on our MongoDB database. Along with Pinata, the web app was built using Flask, Tailwind CSS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MongoDB.
